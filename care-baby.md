像婴儿一样睡眠有完全新的解释，不是说婴儿容易醒，而是他们睡觉也可能非常吵。
To new parents, the term 'sleeping like a baby' can take on a completely new meaning. This is not just due to newborns being very wakeful but they can also be very loud, even when they are asleep.
新生儿呼吸平率比成人快，因为肺部容纳空气的能力弱，需要快进快出。新生儿大概一分钟18-20次/分钟，成人是40-60次/分
A newborn breathes more rapidly than an adult. This is because they don’t have the lung capacity to hold a lot of oxygen so they need to breathe in and out more often. An adult takes about 18-20 breaths in a minute compared with a newborn, who breathes in and out around 40-60 times/minute.

A baby’s breathing is not consistently rhythmic. Newborns take lots of rapid, shallow breaths - almost like they are panting气喘. Sometimes they take longer, slower breaths followed by shallower ones. Then they may pause for a couple of seconds and not take a breath at all. This is what is called “periodic breathing”. It is completely normal in the majority of healthy, well babies. With time and increasing maturity most babies outgrow this pattern of breathing.

In many cases, noisy breathing is caused by the sound of the air flowing over the saliva唾液 which pools集中 at the back of the baby’s throat. Unlike adults, babies are not able to clear their throat, cough when they want to, or consciously control their own breathing.

Sometimes it is helpful to use normal saline 含盐的nose drops. These liquefy the nasal鼻的 secretions分泌物 and help to clear mucous黏液的 which may be obstructing阻挡 the baby’s nostrils鼻孔. However, before doing this, check with your baby’s doctor and make sure there is no medical cause for the noisy breathing.

Babies are noisy breathers because ...
Their airways are small. This means they can’t breathe in a lot of air at the one time. They need to inhale and exhale more frequently than adults do.
A newborn has a very small nose. Their nares (nostrils) are very narrow.
Their nose can become blocked with mucous.
Babies breathe in and out through their nose.
If there is nasal鼻的 congestion拥挤, this makes breathing noisier.
Excess saliva pools in the back of their throat.
My baby is a grunter Some babies grunt and groan like they’ve really got something to complain about. Lots of times they will also sneeze, snore, hiccup and cough even in their sleep. For the observer, they can almost be as entertaining as they are noisy. But as long as the baby is healthy and thriving, feeding well and reaching their milestones, there is generally nothing to be concerned about.

Laryngomalacia
Laryngomalacia is a condition where the tissues sitting above the larynx (the voice box), are not as firm as they could be.  Babies with Laryngomalacia have on and off, noisy breathing when they take a breath in. It is often more obvious when they are crying or feeding.

Usually larynomalacia is noticed within the first couple of weeks of life. Generally it settles by around 12-18 months of age when the floppy松软的 cartilage软骨 develops more tone. Laryngomalacia generally doesn’t need any specific treatment.    

When will my baby make less noise when they are breathing?
Generally by around six months of age, babies stop only nasal breathing. Like adults, they learn how to breathe in through their nose and out through their mouth.

Once your baby is closer to six months, their airways will also be a little larger and their swallowing ability has matured - you’ll probably find they won’t be as noisy.

When to take your baby to a doctor
If your baby is coughing or wheezing.
If your baby has an elevated temperature.
If your baby has signs of a “cold” or other signs of illness.
If you see the area above or below your baby’s rib cage being “sucked in” as they breathe. This can indicate they are using other muscles to get air in and out of their lungs.
If you are concerned or worried.
When to take your baby to the hospital
If your baby stops breathing.
If your baby is limp无力的 or difficult to rouse.
If they are blue or a dusky黝黑的 colour.
结论：新生儿没有用嘴呼吸的能力，只能通过狭窄的鼻腔呼吸，切记不要堵住。呼吸次数多，肺部容纳量少，鼻腔分泌物回倒流，所以各种喘气声，尖而长的喘气。
