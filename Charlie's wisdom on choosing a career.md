# what should a young person look for in a career?

* I have three basic rules.Meeting all three is nearly impossible, but you should try anyway.
 * Don't sell anything you wouldn't buy yourself.
 * Don't work for anyone you don't respect and admire.
 * Work only with people you enjoy.
* I have been incredibly fortunate in my life:with Warren I had all three.
 * You don't have to be brilliant ,only a little bit wiser than the other guys,on average,for a long long time.
 * Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you wake up.Discharge your duties履行你的职责 faithfully and well.Step by step you get head, but not necessarily in fast spurts.But you buld discipline by preparing for fast spurts.Slug it out one inch at a time每一次一锄头重击下去，day-by-day,and at the end of the day -if you live long enough like most people, you can get out of life what you derserve.

* Life and its various passages can be hard, brutally hard.The three things I have found helpfull in coping with its challenges are:
 * Have low expectations.
 * Have a sense of humor.
 * Surround yourself with the love of friends and family.
Above all ,live with change and adapt to it.If the world didn't change,I'd still have a twelve handicap.不利条件，作者自己谦虚自己年龄大落后了。

这篇文章有几个道理显然易见：你要追求快乐幸福，这些比起所谓的成功要重要地多。获得财富和成功需要的是耐性，持续地进步，这往往是大多数人难以做到的。所以作者建议要履行好自己的职责，降低预期，生活中充满幽默和家人朋友的关怀。这样才能度过平坦却又真实的生活，别忘了当你持续进步的时候，没有什么阻挡你最终的幸福。如果时代变化太快，那就去适应它吧，毕竟要比年迈的作者更有优势。
